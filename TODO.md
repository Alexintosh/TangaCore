TODO list
=========

Quick list of things to do in spare order. Though the project is open source
and the code is public we are actually working on the core, so no help welcomed
yet.


- Implements basic plugins:
	- Session management
	- Common features (utilities)
	- Login mechanism
	- Errors handlers. Also it would be nice to have a convenient error()
	  routine which collects errors and fill a report log. A prototype
	  would be in the form of error($txt, $die = false, $dbg = 0) or so.
- Database scheme (and dump sql)
- Write some docs.
